          <p>'A monad is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors'.</p>
          <p>That fact holds everything you need to know about functional programming (FP), right!? If that sentence is a jumble of confusing words to you, you're not alone.</p>
          <p>FP is one of the most powerful programming concepts ever conceived, but it's mired in mountains of terminology and notation and often taught from the top-down. Think about it: it's much easier to think about climbing the mountain once you're already on the top and can see back down. But right now, you're standing at the base of the mountain, ready and eager to climb but all you have is a collection of fancy climbing gear and no clue how to use it to begin the climb.</p>
          <p>This workshop is your primer on how to use this climbing gear to get started up the mountain. Most of the core concepts of FP are actually very intuitive and straightforward, when presented from the ground up without confusing terms or symbolic notations. Functional-light is a look at FP that helps you start the climb, not a lecture on why the climb should be easier than you think it is.</p>
          <p>We'll look at: function parameters, side effects/purity, composition, immutability, closure, recursion, list operations, and more!</p>
          <p>If you're ready to start using FP concepts intuitively and pragmatically to improve your code, and not just hearing confusing terms, this workshop is for you.</p>

          subtitle: 'Full-day Workshop: From zero to a REST API with Node.js',
          descr: "
          <p>A front-end developer that is starting to dwell into Node land face a paradigm change: Node.js is not a Browser. It all starts with the users, as a Browser as one human being in front. A Node.js server can interact with 100s or 1000s of humans at the same time.</p>
          <p>In this course we will dig into the various key components of the Node.js runtime, from EventEmitters to Streams, from fs to http, and do a quick dive on the event loop covering both promises, async/await and process.nextTick. We will learn that Node.js does not come with batteries, and we need to get them from npm and add them to our dependencies.</p>
          <p>The web is populated by blog post, articles and courses that includes several anti-patterns that we have directly seen causing maintainability or performance issues down the line. This course will walk you through some key rules to learn.</p>
          <p>In the last part of this course we will briefly look into how an emergent framework, Fastify, embeds these concepts. We will build a tiny REST application to work with a db (MongoDB): we will use validations, errors, async/await, and a little bit of glue.</p>
          <p>Last but not least, automated tests are must-have practice for Node.js development, and we will explore how to test our routes.</p>

          subtitle: 'Full-day Workshop: TypeScript - From Novice to Expert',
          descr: "
          <p>The JavaScript Eco System is moving to TypeScript. Fast. This workshop will explain why and when you might want to use TypeScript, and get you up and running with all the essentials. In this workshop we will cover practically the full language. And we will go deep.</p>
          <p>This workshop is also suitable for those that have basic experience with TypeScript. Since the basics only take ~2 hours to cover, most of the day is still super valuable to enhance your TypeScript skills, even if you already have real project experience with TypeScript! Did you ever encounter super confusing types in some of the libraries you use? Did you get some super vague compiler errors? After this workshop you will be able to understand them!</p>

          subtitle: '3h Workshop at 9am: React Hooks',
          descr: "
            <p>The React team rewrote the book on developing components. Before we had a choice between classes and functional components. Yet many components needed to be classes. A functional component was often too limited. Now, using hooks, we can extend functional components to be as powerful as we want.</p>
            <p>Join me in this interactive workshop. You will learn all about using the different standard hooks. You will start extracting code from components into you own custom hooks. But be warned, hooks are like a drug. Once tried you too will be hooked. Your components will never be the same again.</p>

            <p>During this workshop you’ll learn about the very basics of Vue such as state, props, components, lifecycle hooks; understand how to use @vue/cli to bootstrap your Vue applications and discover the ecosystem of this progressive JavaScript framework.</p>

            <p>You'll learn a lot with the hands-on approach of this workshop: we'll give you a broken application which you will have to fix, using Vue technology.</p>

            <p>At the end of the session you should be able to: <br/>
            - Write your own Vue components <br/>
            - Manage the state of your application <br/>
            - Use the right lifecycle hooks for the right job</p>

          descr: "
            <p>GraphQL is changing the way we build modern applications, not only by making our apps more efficient but also by giving true autonomy to product & engineering teams and changing the way we think. If your project has heavily invested on REST, this workshop will help you understand and get started quickly with GraphQL by leveraging GraphQL on top of your existing REST API.</p>

            <p>On completion of the workshop each trainee will: <br/>
            - Understand the power of modeling your API using graphs <br/>
            - Learn how to create a GraphQL server using Apollo Server <br/>
            - Understand how to design a modular GraphQL schema <br/>
            - Be able to expose an existing Rest API using a GraphQL API</p>

          subtitle: '3h Workshop at 1pm: Serverless for Front-end Developers',
          descr: "
            <p>As a frontend developer, you often need a backend, either to be able to finish your awesome side project or to create a temporary mock API, until your backend team completes the API they are working on for a few months. But backend development is not easy. Writing some Node.js is just a first piece of it, then you need to set up a server and deploy your app. If your side project becomes successful one day, you’ll need to maintain your server, then scale it. But servers are not pets; sometimes they are more like a Godzilla, a creature that can eat all your free time and destroy your entrepreneurial spirit.</p>
            <p>This workshop will teach you how to create APIs and other serverless backends for your frontend applications, and become a fullstack developer.</p>
