            Amsterdam JSNation is the main happening on the JS stage this year. It unites library authors and core teams with fresh ideas, great people and a summer Amsterdam in the background. We recognize JavaScript development as an art of engineering that is why confernece holds JS art exhibiton, JS driven acts perforoming music and visuals during the afterparty and world known Amsterdam museums to be the place to visit together before that well known JS hangout in the Vondelpark.
