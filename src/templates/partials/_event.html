            Amsterdam JSNation is going to be the main happening of the JS scene in 2020. The conference unites library authors and core teams with fresh ideas, great people, and a summer Amsterdam in the background. We recognize JavaScript development as an art of engineering, and that's why the conference offers both a JS-driven art exhibition and audiovisual performances during the afterparty. After the event, we'll explore the well-known Amsterdam museums together, and later on, we'll gather for a JS hangout in the Vondelpark.
