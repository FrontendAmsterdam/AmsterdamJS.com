            We’re looking specifically at open source projects or initiatives, with or without a code, but following an open and transparent culture, open for collaboration and contributions from any person interested.
          </p>
          <p>Github stars are not our criteria, and we’re looking for hidden gems (non yet maintstream), that may not have enough marketing power or huge companies behind them. The main goal of the project is to shed some light on great projects, that weren’t enough noticed in a competitive environment and hype.</p>
