				question: "Can you issue an invoice for my order?",
				ansver: "Yes, it is possible to pay via invoice. Please, send your company details to hi@amsterdamjs.com and we will issue it for you:<br/>

				VAT number.<br/>
				As soon as we receive the payment, we'll send you a promo-code to activate the tickets."
			},{
				question: "Does my ticket to the conference include workshops also?",
				ansver: "If your ticket states “Early Bird ticket”/”Regular ticket”/”Late Bird ticket”, it only includes a conference day pass. If your ticket states “Combo: Workshop + Conference Day”, it includes both conference day pass and a workshop."
			},{
				question: "How can I change the name in my ticket?",
				ansver: "You can easily change the name in the ticket in your Eventbrite account. Just log in and edit the attendee information. Pay attention that only a ticket buyer account can re-assign tickets."
			},{
				question: "If I can’t visit the conference, can I give the ticket to my friend/colleague?",
				ansver: "Yes, you can. Simply login to your eventbrite account and reassign the ticket to this person. Pay attention that only a ticket buyer account can re-assign tickets."
			},{
				question: "How can I add VAT to the eventbrite invoice?",
				ansver: "Go to your eventbrite account, click “edit”, add the VAT number in the corresponding box, resend confirmation email."
			},{
				question: "Do you provide refunds if my visa is not approved?",
				ansver: "Yes, we can make a refund if your visa for travel was not approved. Please send us the declining letter from the embassy or any other confirming documents."
			},{
				question: "Do you provide refunds if decided not to travel?",
				ansver: "No, we do not provide refunds in this case due to our policies. The reason of such non-refund policy is that we calculate and pre-pay for event facilities and catering in advance."
			},{
				question: "I bought a ticket to workshop, but have another date in my ticket. What is the correct date?",
				ansver: "Please, be attentive with the dates! <br/>
				The correct date is indicated in the name of the ticket - example: “Advanced React Workshop (April 15)”. <br/>
				The ticket will also state the main date of the conference - April 17, although you might not have bought a ticket to the conference itself - this is how eventbrite works, and we cannot change it unfortunately. Pay attention to what the name of the workshop says. <br/>
				<br/>
				If you have doubts - consult the website or email us <a href='mailto:hi@amsterdamjs.com'>hi@amsterdamjs.com</a>"
